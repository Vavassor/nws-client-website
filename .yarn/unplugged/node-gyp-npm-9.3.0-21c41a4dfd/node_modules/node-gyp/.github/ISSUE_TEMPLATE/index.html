<!--
Thank you for reporting an issue!

Remember, this issue tracker is for reporting issues ONLY with node-gyp.

If you have an issue installing a specific module, please file an issue on
that module's issue tracker (`npm issues modulename`). Open issue here only if
you are sure this is an issue with node-gyp, not with the module you are
trying to build.

Fill out the form below. We probably won't investigate an issue that does not
provide the basic information we require.

-->
<p>Please look thru your error log for the string <code>gyp info using node-gyp@</code> and if the version number is less than the <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/releases">current release of node-gyp</a> then <strong>please upgrade</strong> using the instructions at <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/master/docs/Updating-npm-bundled-node-gyp.md">https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/master/docs/Updating-npm-bundled-node-gyp.md</a> and try your command again.</p>
<p>Requests for help with <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues?q=label%3A%22Node+Sass+--%3E+Dart+Sass%22"><code>node-sass</code> are very common</a>. Please be aware that this package is deprecated, you should seek alternatives and avoid opening new issues about it here.</p>
